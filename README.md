# Welcome to the Repository of Yogyakarta Quest
Yogyakarta Quest is an app made by CH2-PS508 students for Bangkit 2023 Capstone Project.
The "Exploring the Uniqueness of Tourism in Yogyakarta" travel application is a project aimed at facilitating tourists in discovering the beauty of Yogyakarta. It offers features such as tourist destination recommendations, quizzes, batik scans, and travel videos/photos as reviews to enhance the travel experience. Yogyakarta, being a popular tourist destination, faces challenges in providing accurate and up-to-date information, affecting educational experiences and travel plans due to limited access to information for visitors.
